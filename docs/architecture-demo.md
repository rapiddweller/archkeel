# Architecture demos

Create a report with several deliberate violations:

```sh
make demo-architecture VARIANT=tour OUTPUT=build/demo.json
```

Use a new output path. The command validates, then writes report JSON and HTML.
Its exit is the higher validation/report exit; read the report's verdict separately.

For Python, Dart and TypeScript UML examples:

```sh
make demo-uml OUTPUT=build/uml-demo
```

Dart inner observation remains unavailable. TypeScript includes PASS, FAIL and UNKNOWN UML cases;
unsupported or ambiguous source facts stay UNKNOWN.

The [catalog](../fixtures/architecture_demo.py) owns all variants, overlays and expected
outcomes. Check-protocol and test-only variants cannot replay as reports.
[Tests](../tests/test_architecture_demo.py) verify the catalog; the guide omits its full inventory.

Regenerate this page: `uv run --locked python -m fixtures.architecture_demo --markdown`.
